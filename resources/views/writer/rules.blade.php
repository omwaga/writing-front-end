            </ul>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">2) Order Handling:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 ml-8">For orders due within 12-24 hours, the document
                MUST be uploaded 1 - 2 hours ahead of time.
                <br> For orders due within 24-72 hours, the document MUST be uploaded
                within 4 - 6 hours ahead of time;

                <br>For orders with 72-144 hours, the document MUST be uploaded within 8
                - 12 hours ahead of time;
                <br>For orders within 6-10 days, the document MUST be uploaded within 12

                within 24 hours ahead of time. </p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7"><span class="font-weight-bold">ALWAYS</span> name your papers whether
                it's a draft, final paper or revision. Customers must clearly understand
                what you have uploaded and to be aware of what stage you are at.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">For example, name your document like this:
                <br>
                "Order 145965 draft”
                <br>
                “Order 145965 final”
                <br>
                “Order 145965 revision” etc.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">To avoid unreasonable cancelations, PLEASE
                always upload a draft to show the progress of your work! </p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">All files and order's details must be viewed, read and understood before
                you place your bid on a particular task. Just to check a topic IS NOT
                enough for taking an order! 
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-bold mt-4">REMEMBER:</h5>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;" class="ml-8 mt-4 leading-7">
                <li>If you decide to go to offline, you HAVE TO delete your bids on
                    urgent orders. Keep in mind, the customer might accept your bid when
                    you are offline and after few hours cancel the order, if you are not
                    responsive.
                </li>
                <li>Do not wait until customers are online but raise an inquiry once
                    before your bid is accepted.
                </li>
                <li>All files and order's details must be viewed, read and understood
                    before you place your bid on a particular task. Just to check a
                    topic IS NOT enough for taking an order!
                </li>
                <li>Irresponsible placing of bids:
                    <ul class="violations">
                        <li>spoils your reputation with a failed order which you,
                            eventually, couldn't handle; 
                        <li>wastes the customer's time; </li>
                        <li>takes away a chance of other (more competent in this field)
                            writer to complete this task;
                        </li>
                        <li>damages our reputation as a company which leads to reducing
                            of order flow.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">3) CUSTOMER APPROACH:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">According to the legend in your profiles, some of you have been
                professors/tutors in the past. Hence, your writing skills and behavior
                in the chat should match your status.</p>
            <p>So here are reminders and advice for you: </p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7 ml-8">
                1. Start working on the order immediately and try to finish it as fast
                as you can. It will help you to avoid deadline missing in case if the
                customer asks for the revision. Also, it will increase your chances to
                win the trust of customers, and they will come back to you with new
                orders, to avoid cancellations and suspensions for the failed orders and
                missed deadlines. <br>
                2. Do not take more orders than you can handle. It’s better to finish
                all your orders with excellent quality, time management, and just an
                excellent service. It will bring you more 5 stars reviews and returning
                customers. As you know, you get 40% of the total price for each
                returning customer. Moreover, you will avoid the suspension that leads
                to the absence of new orders and the permanent block after.<br>
                3. Do not complain about the suspension or payment in the order's chat.
                It is forbidden to mention internal information and rules which concern
                you as a writer.
                <br>
                4. Do not tell customers where you are from. You work remotely. If you
                need to agree the time to be online or upload the paper, do not tell
                about the time difference. It is better to say how many hours from now.
                (in 5 hours from now, in 20 hours from now, etc.) <br>
                5. Do not spam with “Hello”. Send complete sentences instead of “Hello”
                and silence. The same with the support team. If you have an inquiry,
                just specify it as clear as you can and wait for the response. 
                <br>
                6. Do not ever accept bids of Doctorate level if you aren't able to
                handle them. Start your career with simple assignments; do not take a
                risk with complicated orders. It will help you avoid suspensions and the
                permanent block of your account. 
                <br>
                7. Do not ever promise A+ grade! According to our T&Cs, you can
                guarantee a quality paper but not A grade. 
                <br>
                8. To avoid confusions, do not ever delete uploaded papers even if they
                aren’t downloaded by customers.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">Deadline cheating:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Sometimes customers set deadlines for months but require to finish the
                paper earlier. It is considered cheating from their side. This way they
                pay less for urgent orders.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">If it happens to you, inform the customer that s/he should replace the
                order with correct deadline and price.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Mind, it is referred to the case with deadlines for months, but not for a
                few days.</p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">4) PAYOUTS: </p>
            <p class="font-bold">Please stick to your verified payment method,
                otherwise, your request will not be processed. </p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">We will proceed payments through Paypal and Bank Cards. </p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">Here are the instructions:</p>
            <p><span class="mt-4 leading-7">For Paypal:</span> Upload a screenshot of
                your PayPal account showing your profile. Once you add the image, get
                back to support team.</p>
            <p><span class="class=" mt-4 leading-7"">For Bank Card:</span> Provide a photo of
                your card along with you National ID. (Should be in 1 photo!)
                Once added get back to support team as well, so that they can pass the
                inquiry to the Billing department for approval.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Our regular payout schedule is on the last day of the month (30th or
                31st) and mid-month the 15th.</p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold leading-7">Please place your withdrawal request one day
                before the payout date; otherwise, it won't be processed. </p>
            <p>Also, we provide payments once a week AT OUR DISCRETION.</p>
            <p class="italic leading-7 mt-4">Notice: the billing department processes requests
                until the end of the day so no need to contact us with questions about
                upcoming payout and raise the issue of payment delay when the payout day
                IS NOT over. </p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4">5) APPROACHING NEW ORDERS: </p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Remember please, if you want to succeed in taking orders, you must be
                online most of your time. You must respond as soon, as the customer
                leaves you a message in the chat. Only those new writers, who are online
                almost all the time, with some breaks to sleep can succeed in taking
                their first orders.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">When you read instructions and something is not clear or additional
                information is needed, ALWAYS ask questions BEFORE you get hired and
                inform a customer that you will not be able to handle the task without
                clarifying these points.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7 ml-8">1. Attentively check the order’s instructions to discuss them with a
                customer<br>
                2. Once a bid is placed, send a short message in the chat box; this
                message makes the first impression on the customer— that is why we
                recommend you to pay attention to it:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Do not use any pre-written sample, but make it individual; there are 100
                and 1 things you can include in it. Just a few things:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7 ml-8">1. Your experience in writing/ the required field <br>
                2. Awareness of the topic <br>
                3. Ability to meet a deadline <br>
                4. Access to the sources <br>
                5. 100% originality <br>
                3. Be ready to answer customer's questions and do not hesitate to ask
                questions as well — all the issues must be clarified before you are
                assigned
                <br>
                4. Keep in touch with the customer until you are assigned <br>
                5. No more than two messages till the customer’s reply. Do not spam.
                <br>
                6. Use uppercase “ I “. (e.g. I can, I will, etc.) <br>
                7. Do not beg the customer to assign you the order. Do not use words
                like “Kindly” or “please”.
                <br>
                8. Do not use “CAPS LOCK”. <br>
                9. Do not use “Dear”, “Friend”, “Buddy”, “Halo” => Hello, Hello
                Customer, Hi.
                <br>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Minimum CPP is $3.5</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Even so, we strongly recommend you to put a higher price as writer’s bids
                quantity is quite low due to the big amount of available orders.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">But still, writers can reduce the price to the minimum one on customers'
                request.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">This is the chance to increase your earnings and precise your efforts in
                the right way. Don't forget, we keep an eye on it. </p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4 leading-7">*Regarding the order with the deadline of 24
                hours/Urgent orders:</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">If you place a bid and are going to go offline in a few hours, let the
                customer know when you will be back online.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">You may say how many hours from now. (in 5 hours from now, in 8 hours
                from now, etc.) It will help you to avoid needless cancellation and
                suspension.*</p>
            <p class="font-bold mt-4 leading-7">Check order instructions VERY attentively before
                placing your bids.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">If there are no detailed instructions and no attached files in the order,
                you have to ask for it! You can always ask customers about additional
                files (previous works) which can help you to complete an order better
                and faster. (Follow a customer’s writing style)</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Remember, your message always MUST be the last in the order's chat. This
                way a customer is sure that you got the point.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Important Note: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK FOR A
                CLIENT’S EMAIL AND OFFER YOUR SERVICES DIRECTLY.</p>
            <p class="italic mt-7 leading-7"> If such attempts are detected, your writer’s account
                will be locked with no excuses.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7 font-bold">Our primary goal has always been to develop and
                improve services for our customers making the final product better. By
                consistently providing clients with high-quality work handled by

                for complete customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">Cooperation with frauds is strictly prohibited and leads to the permanent
                blocking of a writer’s account.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 leading-7">(Once you suspect a customer to be involved in fraudulent activities, you
                must inform us and stop working on his/her project immediately.
                If we detect such cooperation, we will lock a writer’s account without
                the payout. No excuses and explanation can be accepted afterward.)</p>
