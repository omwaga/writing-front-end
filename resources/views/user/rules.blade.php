                <p class="mt-2 font-bold" style="margin-top: 10px">Placing an order:</p>
                <p class="mt-2 font-bold">Have you prepared everything you need?</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7">When placing an order on Essay Flame, you must provide the following
                    details
                    for our writers to better understand how they can help you. The inputs
                    necessary are Assignment Type, Service Type, Deadline Date, Language,
                    Number of Pages/Words, Academic Level, Custom Instructions and any
                    Uploadable Files that may help your writer understand the task
                    clearly.</p>

                <p class="pl-4 leading-7 text-green-500">TIP: Please be careful when choosing the deadline
                    for your paper. We HIGHLY recommend setting your deadline AT LEAST 24
                    hours before the official submission date. This will give you enough
                    time to proofread the paper and ask for a revision if necessary.</p>
                <p class="mt-2 font-bold">Bidding phase:</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7">Once you have filled out all of the requirements and clicked “Place
                    Order”, our writers will see your new order in the system and begin
                    placing their bids to win the contract for your order. We have many
                    writers that are highly talented, and they all want the chance to prove
                    themselves. That being said, when considering a writer, be sure to chat
                    with them using the writer window and scan their bios to see metrics
                    such as # of completed orders, subject of expertise and customer
                    reviews. This will help you select a writer for your task.</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7 text-green-500">TIP: After selecting a writer and clicking “Hire”,
                    it’s necessary to deposit funds into your account for the writer to
                    begin the assignment. Please ensure that your card is valid for
                    international transactions and that it has sufficient funds. You may
                    also pay with PayPal if none of your cards are working properly!</p>
                <p class="font-bold leading-7">The “Order In Progress” Phase:</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7">After successfully depositing funds and starting the contract with your
                    writer, they shall begin working on your assignment. During the span of
                    the contract, be sure to chat with them using the writer window. You may
                    ask for revisions, request edits in the tone of voice and style or even
                    offer them references to beef up your paper. Furthermore, you can set
                    milestones for your writer and pay them in increments after they finish
                    certain stages. Overall, make sure to be in contact with the writer -
                    this will improve the overall quality of your paper!</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7 text-green-500">TIP: Here at Essay Flame, we have an unlimited
                    revisions policy. You can ask for as many edits as you want until you
                    are fully content with the final paper, without having to pay extra!
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold leading-7">Completing the contract:</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7">Once your writer has sent you the final version of the paper that you are
                    fully content with, please be sure to double-check and proofread
                    everything. When everything is up to your standards, simply click
                    “Release Payment” and pay the writer for their efforts. Also, we HIGHLY
                    recommend making minor edits to the content so that the writing style
                    aligns more closely with your natural level. It will give you peace of
                    mind :)</p>
                <p class="pl-4 leading-7 text-green-500">TIP: Before submission, we highly recommend that you
                    create an empty document on your personal computer and copy-paste the
                    information onto there. Every file on any PC has its own metadata
                    information such as name, date, etc. By following this step, you become
                    the ORIGINAL owner of the file.</p>
